# Neighborhood Safety Trends in Philadelphia

## Overview
This project presents an interactive web-based dashboard designed to help Philadelphia residents, and prospective homebuyers understand how neighborhood safety is changing over time. Using crime data from the Philadelphia Police Department’s Part I and Part II Crime Incidents dataset (2023 to 2025), the dashboard visualizes patterns of burglary, property crime, and other reported incidents across the city.

Users can search for a specific neighborhood boundary and see whether crime levels have increased or decreased. A color-coded map layer highlights areas experiencing change: red tones indicate rising incidents, while green tones signal improvements. Clicking any neighborhood reveals a pop-up summary. Users can also adjust the time window (6 months, 1 year, 2 years) to explore both short- and long-term trends. There are also checkboxes where users can pick the types of crime they want to look at, such as burglary, theft, or motor vehicle theft, to see the numbers and how each category has been changing.
